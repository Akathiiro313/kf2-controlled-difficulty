This game mode replaces the standard KFGameConductor class provided by Tripwire with a new subclass called CD_DummyGameConductor.  KFGameConductor defines a method called TimerUpdate() which CD_DummyGameConductor overrides.  TimerUpdate() is called once a second and is the primary entry point for Game Conductor to influence the game difficulty.  In KFGameConductor, this method updates some difficulty variables (including spawnrate) in response to some barbaric heuristics about how well the player is supposedly doing.  In CD_DummyGameConductor, this method does the following:

* set CurrentSpawnRateModification to SpawnMod (which is defined in KFGame.ini or console command)
* set CurrentAIMovementSpeedMod to DifficultyInfo.GetAIGroundSpeedMod()
* (nothing else)

Note that this makes CD_DummyGameConductor more generous to the player, by default, than KFGameConductor on HOE.  KFGameConductor is free to vary CurrentSpawnRateModification between 0.75 and 1.0 on HOE, and if you kill zeds well below par lifetime (17s) with headshots on a small map like KF-Hillside, you will drive the spawn mod down to 0.75 well before getting 10 kills.  CD_DummyGameConductor allows configuring CurrentSpawnRateModification, but it defaults to 1.0, the gentlest value available to KFGameConductor's HOE settings.  Note that CurrentSpawnRateModification is a misnomer inherited from Tripwire code.  It does not really modify the rate of spawn, but rather the time interval between spawns. Smaller numbers means tougher gameplay, even though you would guess the exact opposite from the variable name.  In other words, 0.75 is a zerg rush, and 1.0 is a slow trickle.

This game mode also replaces KFDifficultyInfo with a new subclass called CD_DifficultyInfo.  CD_DifficultyInfo overrides a pair of methods:

* GetPlayerNumMaxAIModifier( byte NumLivingPlayers )
* GetTraderTimeByDifficulty()

GetPlayerNumMaxAIModifier controls two things:

1. Wave size increases attributable to player count
2. The amount of dosh rewarded for killing a zed

Point 2 may sound a bit odd, but it's consistent with the ordinary game; the mod's not giving out free candy.  Recall that a six player game does not have zedcount = (number of zeds in a one player game) * 6.  It has far fewer zeds than that (4.5x on HOE).  The game quietly increases the dosh rewarded for killing zeds on higher player counts to give everyone, on average, the same amount they would get solo.  So, on 6p HOE, zeds give 33% more dosh than on solo.  The mod just continues this behavior.

GetTraderTimeByDifficulty just checks for the presence of the TraderTime override, and, if it is not found or is not a positive number, uses the default value for the appropriate difficulty level instead.
