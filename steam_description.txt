[h1][b]Summary[/b][/h1]
This custom build takes everything you know and love about Blackout's Controlled Difficulty and adds some additional features, perhaps the most notable of which is the ready system and autopause which allows players to ready up eliminating the need to have someone on server with CDAUTH_WRITE permissions to pause and unpause between waves. This should also help eliminate or reduce erroneous unpauses that can cause wipes. Once every non-spectator is readied up the ready system will automatically unpause the trader and resume the countdown. In the event of something forgotten- If there are more than 5 seconds remaining on the countdown (or if you're playing in solo mode) players can un-ready in order pause the countdown again.

Combined with the ability to set TraderTime in your config (I recommend a low number, like 8 or 12 seconds) this should also make unmanaged pausing/unpausing available to public CD servers while also making it easier for managed CD groups.

[h1][b]Additional Features[/b][/h1]
In addition to everything offered by Blackout's Controlled Difficulty this fork includes the following additions and changes:

[list]
[*] CD Chatbox output is now in ORANGE (blame Kore for giving me the idea)
    I plan to add the option to change this to a custom color of your choosing in the future.
[*] nam_pro_v5_plus spawncycle added to available presets
[*] gso_v1 spawncycle added to available presets
[*] fixes BossHPFakes not applying to Abomination and KingFleshpound
[*] BossHPFakes are now listed in cdinfo output during and after bosswave
[*] AutoPause
    A simple feature that automagically pauses the trader at the end of each wave
    [list]
    [*] !cdautopause (shorthand: !cdap) chat command to enable or disable autopause
    [*] config option to enable or disable AutoPause
    [/list]
[*] Ready System
    Manages player ready/unready states and automates unpausing of trader time.
    [list]
    [*] !cdready (shorthand: !cdr) chat command to ready up for the next wave
    [*] !cdunready (shorthand: !cdur) chat command to unready
    [*] !cdusereadysystem (shorthand: !cdurs) chat command to turn the ready system on and off
    [*] config option to turn the ready system on and off
    [/list]
[*] numerous !cdwho chat command functionality fixes and additions:
    [list]
    [*] no longer counts faked players as spectators
    [*] no longer lists real players as spectators during trader time
    [*] now correctly lists spectators prior to the start of wave 1
    [*] now lists who is readied up and who is not during trader time (for use with ready system)
    [/list]
[*] !cdMyStats chat command
    Displays a list of your current stats for the match including the following:
    [list]
    [*] Dosh Earned
    [*] Large Kills
    [*] Healing Given
    [*] Healing Received
    [*] Damage Dealt
    [*] Damage Taken
    [*] Shots Fired
    [*] Shots Hit
    [*] Accuracy (Measured as % of shots hit)
    [*] Headshots
    [/list]
[*] !cdAllHpFakes chat command
    allows players with CDAUTH_WRITE permissions to set HP fakes for Trash, Scrakes, Fleshpounds, and Boss to the same value all at once.
[*] !cdWaveEndSummaries (Shorthand: !cdwes) chat command
    toggles the display of wave end spawn summaries. Also available as a config option.
[*] !cdstats command to display a sorted list of a specified stat for all connected players- Supported stats are:
[list]
[*] Accuracy
[*] Dosh Earned
[*] Damage Done
[*] Heals Given
[*] Headshots
[*] Large Kills
[/list]
[/list]

It should be noted that if someone who is not readied up leaves for whatever reason (Network disconnect, they were kicked, client crash, etc) and everyone left is readied up- the trader will not automatically unpause- this is an intended feature meant to safe-guard against unexpected problems that may arise. If that player isn't coming back you can trigger the ready-check again simply by having one player unready then ready back up.

[h1][b]Finding CD Players and Servers[/b][/h1]
I've put together a small group to help people find public CD servers and groups to play with in their region. There's still a fair bit of information to fill out and if you'd like your group or server added to the lists provided please feel free to comment below the list in each section with the appropriate information.
