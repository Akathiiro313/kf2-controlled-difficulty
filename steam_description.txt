[b]Controlled Difficulty - Akathiiro313's Build[/b]
[b]Updated:[/b] Aug 3rd, 2018
[b]Last Tested:[/b] v1068


[h1]Introduction[/h1]

This version of CD is based on Tiger' Build, and origins from [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=738484519]Blackout's Controlled Difficulty[/url]
Used the source code from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1412883748]DarkDarkington's Controlled Difficulty[/url]
I don't own most of the credit of this version, it's Blackout and Tiger who create this beloved mutator, and DarkDarkington who keeps the source code of Tiger' Build while keeps CD going.
I only fix some severe breakages caused by the V1065 patch about the albino zeds control and add some additional features.
I don't have much experience in script mod, so in any event of future update that severely breaks CD, i might not be able to maintain this mutator running. This version of CD is made to in memory of those glory days that CD brought us.


[h1]Features[/h1]

It keeps everything offered by Blackout's Controlled Difficulty and Tiger's improvement in his build with DarkDarkington's changes(except for color).You can find the features of Tiger's version of CD in DarkDarkington 's CD in the link above.


[b]My personal changes:[/b]

[list]
    [*]Fixed breakage caused by v1065 patch so that albino control works again.(You can use CD's chat command to disable or enable albino zeds again)
    [*]Added chat command to control spawn of the EDARs since they are a kind of albino zeds now.(!cdalbinostalkers and !cdalbinohusks are used to control EDARs' spawn) But you have to disable both albino stalkers and husks to prevent them from spawning if there are EDARs in your spawncycle.(Further changes might convert two commands to one)
    [*]Now supports speific EDAR in custom spawncycle, you can either use the specified names to spawn specific EDAR but you can not disable them via chat command, or you can use ST* and HU* to spawn random EDARs while you can disable them via chat command.
For specified EDAR names, the following are accpected:
* DARE(MP), DE, TR, Trapper
* DARR(OCKET), DR, BO, Boomer
* DARL(ASER), DL, BA, Blaster
    [*]Added spawncycle preset ts_mig_v1 (proabaly known as mig_v1) designed by Machine and coded by me. It's designed to have approximatly the same ammout of large zeds as dtf_v1 but armed with many albino zeds and more annoying zeds squad combos.
    [*]Added spawncycle preset ts_mig_v1_p also designed by Machine and coded by me. It's the prototype of mig_v1 but I think it's a pity to dump it so I add it as a separate spawncycle, wave 8-10 was more brutal compared to mig_v1 and perhaps a little unbanlanced due to wave 10.
    [*]Added spawncycle preset ts_lk313_stg designed by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/LKarrie]LKarrie[/url] and modified by me. It has more large zeds than nam_pro_v5 but less than dtf_v1 and armed with few albino zeds and QPs.
    [*]Text color changed to pink. (Blame Machine for this 'cause he likes it)
    [*]Added command !cdmig. (Thank Machine to be one of the best KF2 player)
    [*]Adjusted spawncycle preset so that every preset designed for solo now supports both short game and long game.
