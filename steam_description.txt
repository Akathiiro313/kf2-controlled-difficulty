[b]Last tested on[/b]: KF2 EA version 1040 / Aug 6 2016
[b]Mod Version[/b]:  b334b8e (built 2016-08-09)

This open source mod creates a custom game mode called ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival, which does the following:

* Disables the game conductor's variation of the zed spawn intensity and move speed
* Supports 'faking' players; this increases the zed count (but not zed health) as though additional players were present
* Supports setting an arbitrary, fixed spawn intensity, without conductor interference
* Supports setting an arbitrary trader time

This mod is pretty much just meant for solo faked-player HOE attempts.

This mod is somewhat similar to, but less comprehensive than, Skell's Project One mod.  I made this because I think Project One has not been updated in a while (December 2015 atm).  I'm trying to keep the scope focused so that it will be simple to fix as future KF2 patches inevitably break it.

When you add fake players, the zed count goes up as if they were human, but their HP and head HP remain at solo levels.  Since version b334b8e (built 2016-08-09), rewards you receive for killing zeds are computed as though faked players were real players.  In older versions of this mod, zed kill rewards scaled down so that each human player received a solo per-wave dosh budget regardless of zedcount, which made some attempts unnecessarily annoying or impossible.  Now you can choose not to buy if you want to restrain your economy.

Aside from faking players, this mod lets you precisely control spawn intensity.  In the vanilla game, the Game Conductor controls intensity, which is expressed as a floating point number.  The vanilla GC varies the intensity value based on some crude heuristics about how well the player is supposedly doing, making the spawn rate feel unpredictable and encouraging dumb strategies like intentionally missing shots or kiting zeds so that their average lifetime value goes up.  In this mod, you set an exact spawn intensity.  It does not change during play.  Your performance does not influence it.  For reference, HOE Game Conductor varies this intensity measure between 1.0 and 0.75, where 1.0 is lowest HOE intensity and 0.75 is highest HOE intensity.  Choosing a value in this range is recommended.   Specifying 1.0 is like locking the game at constant minimum HOE spawn intensity (the mod defaults to this until you configure otherwise).  Specifying 0.75 is like locking the game at constant peak HOE spawn intensity. 

This mod persists the last settings used to KFGame.ini under the [ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival] section.  All mod options can be specified through parameters to the 'open' console command; the KFGame.ini section merely remembers the last options explicitly specified this way, so that you don't have to repeatedly type parameters that you never change.  It does not require .ini edits to get started.  You can paste one of the console commands listed below to get started.

The intended audience for this mod is solo HOE players.  I recommend against running it on a public server.

This mod only activates when you run an 'open' console command and specify the '?game=ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival' parameter as shown in the next section.  This mod does not alter the vanilla game.  Games started through the GUI menus or without that parameter will continue to use vanilla difficulty settings.

[h1]Console Command Examples (Start Here)[/h1]

The easiest way to get started is to open the KF2 console (using the ` or ~ key on US keyboards) and to paste one of the following commands.  Change the map name to whatever you want.

// One faked player (assuming solo play, that makes two total), 30
// second trader time, HOE difficulty, Long duration game, SpawnMod
// either defaults to 1.0 or is read from KFGame.ini if defined under
// the [ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival] section.
// Map is KF-Hillside-B3.
open KF-Hillside-B3?game=ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival?Difficulty=3?GameLength=2?TraderTime=30?FakePlayers=1

// Same as above, except the SpawnMod is set to 0.75.
// SpawnMod is the "spawn intensity" described in the summary section.
// For more info about what SpawnMod does, see that section.
open KF-Hillside-B3?game=ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival?Difficulty=3?GameLength=2?TraderTime=30?FakePlayers=1?SpawnMod=0.75

GameLength values:
0 = Short
1 = Medium
2 = Long

Difficulty values:
0 = Normal
1 = Hard
2 = Suicidal
3 = HOE

Recommended SpawnMod values:
(harder) 0.75 ... 1.0 (easier)

[h1]KFGame.ini Sample[/h1]

Editing KFGame.ini before using the mod is supported but unnecessary.  See the previous section for sample console commands that start a game using the mod.  The mod will automatically write its KFGame.ini section with the configuration values that you last provided on the console.

KFGame.ini is in <your homedir>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config, e.g.

[ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival]
FakePlayers=1
TraderTime=25
SpawnMod=1.0

To disable any of these three customizations from turning on in the ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival mode by default, delete the associated line from KFGame.ini.  If the KFGame.ini section is missing or incomplete,  ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival assumes:

* no faked players
* standard trader time for the difficulty level
* SpawnMod = 1.0

[h1]Logging[/h1]

Configure logging by either:

* Setting bLogControlledDifficulty=<true|false> in KFGame.ini's [ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival] KFGame.ini section
* Running logControlledDifficulty <true|false> in the console
