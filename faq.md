# Frequently Asked Questions

### How does CD relate to [Skell's Faked Suite](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768190709) and Project One mods?

I made this mod after P1 went unmaintained, but before Skell returned to make his [Faked Suite](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768190709).
There is significant feature overlap, though some things are unique on each side. Both mods are good.

### Where can I get KF-Hillside?

This is Skell's map. Skell posted this map to both the Tripwire forums and to the Steam Workshop.

Steam Workshop link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769353502

CD works with any map, not just Hillside. But Hillside is good for a lot of solo challenges.

### Is CD on Tripwire's whitelist?

No. Want CD whitelisted?  Only Tripwire has the power to add CD to their whitelist; politely ask: https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/forum/killing-floor-2/killing-floor-2-modifications/general-modding-discussion-ad/120340-whitelisting-mods-and-mutators

### Can I level up my perks in CD?

No. Tripwire decided to prevent perk progression when the server is running any non-whitelisted modifications.
CD is not on TWI's whitelist.
While playing CD, your perks will not persistently gain or lose XP.

### Why doesn't this work with the "FP Legs + Backpack Weapons" mutator?

CD doesn't work with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679113913. At a minimum, that mutator appears to break CD's chat commands. For all I know, it breaks other things too; I haven't checked.

That mutator's description says that it 'is not compatible with mods that replace the pawn or controller such as ServerExt,' and CD does indeed subclass the player controller. I can only speculate as to what's going on here, because that mutator's source is, as best I can tell, closed. CD is open source for all.
