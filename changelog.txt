* fixed SpawnMod=0 handling
    Prior to this commit, specifying SpawnMod=0 as a parameter to the open
    command had unintuitive behavior that depended on whether a saved
    SpawnMod value was present in KFGame.ini.

    * If you ran `open ...?SpawnMod=0` and KFGame.ini had a
      [ControlledDifficulty.CD_Survival] section with a SpawnMod value
      (true if KFGame.ini is not readonly and you've played the mod
      before), then the KFGame.ini value was used (which might not be 0!)

    * If you ran `open ...?SpawnMod=0` and KFGame.ini had no SpawnMod
      value (true if you never played the mod before or if KFGame.ini is
      readonly), 0.0 was used

    I recommended that people stick to the range [0.75, 1.0] in the mod
    description, but I probably should have foreseen that people would try
    0.0 even though it was not recommended.  I see that Kore and Fat Cat
    have already tried SpawnMod=0, for instance.

    The true SpawnMod value appears in the log, but people don't usually
    run KF2 with the `-log` option, so that doesn't help them.

    I've made a couple of changes to fix this.

    1. I rewrote the parameter handling to avoid the KFGame.ini-dependence
    mentioned above.  Now if you run `open ...?SpawnMod=0`, you will
    actually get SpawnMod=0 regardless of KFGame.ini or anything else.
    Note that the spawning subsytem in the base game still only spawns one
    squad of zeds per second, and squads tend to be about 5 zeds in size,
    give or take a couple.  So, even with SpawnMod=0, it could take
    several seconds to reach the MaxMonsters limit.

    2. I made the mod print its effective configuration values to the
    console every time you run the `open` command (technically, this
    happens in the `InitGame()` function).  So, when you open a map with
    the mod, you now see something like printed to your console:

    [ControlledDifficulty] FakePlayers=2
    [ControlledDifficulty] TraderTime=45
    [ControlledDifficulty] SpawnMod=0.75
    [ControlledDifficulty] MaxMonsters=<unmodded default>

    To those who set SpawnMod=0 and got burned by this weird
    KFGame.ini-dependence, I apologize.  I hope the change above will make
    the mod's effective values more transparent, in addition to just
    fixing this specific problem.

* added MaxMonsters param
    Before this commit, the mod did not alter the vanilla game's
    MaxMonsters logic.  MaxMonsters is an int correspoding to the maximum
    amount of concurrent live zeds the spawning subsystem allows on a map.
    In the vanilla game, dedicated servers use 32 (even if you play by
    yourself on a dedicated server), whereas non-dedicated (NM_StandAlone)
    use 16.  So, if you run KF2 and open a modded game from the main menu,
    you had MaxMonsters=16, consistent with the vanilla game.

    This is now configurable.  You can append ?MaxMonsters=32 or whatever
    you like.  Values greater than zero are interpreted literally.  For
    instance, if you specify ?MaxMonsters=32, you will see this printed to
    the console after the map loads:

    [ControlledDifficulty] MaxMonsters=32

    Nonpositive values are interpreted to mean "use the vanilla game's
    MaxMonsters" (which will be 16 if you play non-dedicated solo).  For
    instance, if you specify ?MaxMonsters=0 or ?MaxMonsters=-1 (or any
    other negative value), you will see this printed to the console after
    the map loads:

    [ControlledDifficulty] MaxMonsters=<unmodded default>

* fixed delayed param handling on FakePlayers and TraderTime
    mike5879 noticed that changes to the FakePlayers and TraderTime
    options only take effect after running the open command twice.  It was
    as though changes to these values were delayed by one invocation of
    `open` command.  Fortunately, this only affected FakePlayers and
    TraderTime, which are easy to check.  It did not affect SpawnMod.

    This was caused by an ordering bug in my config handling code.  This
    is now fixed.  All options specified on the `open` command line should
    take effect immediately (and they will also be saved to KFGame.ini if
    it is not readonly, as happens already).

------------------------
* updated to KF2 v1043
* followed upstream restructuring of KFDifficultyInfo
* rewrote CD_Survival's GameConductor and DifficultyInfo customization to
override the InitGameConductor and CreateDifficultyInfo functions rather than
overriding the entire PreBeginPlay event
